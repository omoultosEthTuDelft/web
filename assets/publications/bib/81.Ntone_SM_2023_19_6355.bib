abstract  ="It has been reported that lipid droplets (LDs){,} called oleosomes{,} have an inherent ability to inflate or shrink when absorbing or fueling lipids in the cells{,} showing that their phospholipid/protein membrane is dilatable. This property is not that common for membranes stabilizing oil droplets and when well understood{,} it could be exploited for the design of responsive and metastable droplets. To investigate the nature of the dilatable properties of the oleosomes{,} we extracted them from rapeseeds to obtain an oil-in-water emulsion. Initially{,} we added an excess of rapeseed oil in the dispersion and applied high-pressure homogenization{,} resulting in a stable oil-in-water emulsion{,} showing the ability of the molecules on the oleosome membrane to rearrange and reach a new equilibrium when more surface was available. To confirm the rearrangement of the phospholipids on the droplet surface{,} we used molecular dynamics simulations and showed that the fatty acids of the phospholipids are solubilized in the oil core and are homogeneously spread on the liquid-like membrane{,} avoiding clustering with neighbouring phospholipids. The weak lateral interactions on the oleosome membrane were also confirmed experimentally{,} using interfacial rheology. Finally{,} to investigate whether the weak lateral interactions on the oleosome membrane can be used to have a triggered change of conformation by an external force{,} we placed the oleosomes on a solid hydrophobic surface and found that they destabilise{,} allowing the oil to leak out{,} probably due to a reorganisation of the membrane phospholipids after their interaction with the hydrophobic surface. The weak lateral interactions on the LD membrane and their triggered destabilisation present a unique property that can be used for a targeted release in foods{,} pharmaceuticals and cosmetics."}
