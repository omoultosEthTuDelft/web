abstract = {The solubility parameter (SP) of a solvent is a key property that measures the polarity and quantifies the ‘like-dissolves-like’ principle, which is an important rule in chemistry for screening solvents for separation processes. It is challenging to experimentally obtain solubility parameters of non-volatile solvents like ionic liquids (ILs), deep eutectic solvents (DESs), and polymers. Here, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to compute the Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameters of DESs, which are green solvents with potential applications in many different fields. The results from MD simulations are compared with limited available experimental data and commonly used SP correlations for non-volatile solvents. Very limited information is available in literature for the vapor phase composition of DESs. Solubility parameters are computed based on the vaporization of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) components of the DESs as well as clusters, consisting of HBD and HBA components. The relatively large SPs computed from MD indicate that the investigated choline chloride-based DESs are polar solvents. The values of SPs are not significantly affected by temperature. A comparison of vaporization enthalpies of HBD, HBA and clusters from the DES mixture suggests that it is more likely for HBD molecules to vaporize from the DES mixture and dominate the vapor phase.}
