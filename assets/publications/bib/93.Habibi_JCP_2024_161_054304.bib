    abstract = "{Vapor–Liquid Equilibria (VLE) of hydrogen (H2) and aqueous electrolyte (KOH and NaCl) solutions are central to numerous industrial applications such as alkaline electrolysis and underground hydrogen storage. Continuous fractional component Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compute the VLE of H2 and aqueous electrolyte solutions at 298–423 K, 10–400 bar, 0–8 mol KOH/kg water, and 0–6 mol NaCl/kg water. The densities and activities of water in aqueous KOH and NaCl solutions are accurately modeled (within 2\\% deviation from experiments) using the non-polarizable Madrid-2019 Na+/Cl− ion force fields for NaCl and the Madrid-Transport K+ and Delft Force Field of OH− for KOH, combined with the TIP4P/2005 water force field. A free energy correction (independent of pressure, salt type, and salt molality) is applied to the computed infinite dilution excess chemical potentials of H2 and water, resulting in accurate predictions (within 5\\% of experiments) for the solubilities of H2 in water and the saturated vapor pressures of water for a temperature range of 298–363 K. The compositions of water and H2 are computed using an iterative scheme from the liquid phase excess chemical potentials and densities, in which the gas phase fugacities are computed using the GERG-2008 equation of state. For the first time, the VLE of H2 and aqueous KOH/NaCl systems are accurately captured with respect to experiments (i.e., for both the liquid and gas phase compositions) without compromising the liquid phase properties or performing any refitting of force fields.}",
