<!-- Asterios Katsifodimos is an assistant professor at TU Delft. Prior to that, he worked at the SAP Innovation Center in Berlin, designing and implementing scale-out data management architectures for SAP's Leonardo ML foundation. Before joining SAP, Asterios spent three years as a senior researcher with the database systems group in TU Berlin led by Prof. Volker Markl, working on language models and systems for scalable analytics. Asterios received his PhD from INRIA Saclay & Universite Paris-Sud in 2013 for his work on distributed database architectures based on materialised views, under the supervision of Ioana Manolescu. During his MSc studies, Asterios was a researcher at the High Performance Computing systems Lab (HPCL, now LINC), at the University of Cyprus, led by Marios Dikaiakos. More information and a full list of publications can be found in his personal website: http://asterios.katsifodimos.com. -->
