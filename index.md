Assistant Professor, <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/process-energy/people/engineering-thermodynamics/">Engineering Thermodynamics</a>. Department of <a href="hhttps://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/process-energy">Process & Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/">Mechanical Engineering Faculty</a>, <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/">Delft University of Technology</a>.</strong>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

Before joining TU Delft, I was a research scientist at the <a href="https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/programs/chemical-engineering">Chemical Engineering Program</a> of Texas A&M University at Qatar in the group of <a href="https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/programs/chemical-engineering/faculty-and-staff/dr.-ioannis-economou">Prof. Ioannis Economou</a> working on molecular modeling of chemical mixtures relevant to CCUS proccesses. In 2014, I spent time as a postdoc in the group of <a href="https://cbe.princeton.edu/people/athanassios-panagiotopoulos">Prof. Athanassios Panagiotopoulos</a> at <a href="https://cbe.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>. In 2013, I obtained a PhD in Physical Chemistry of Polymers from the <a href="https://www.uoi.gr/en/">University of Ioannina</a> supervised by <a href="https://chem.uoi.gr/en/meli-dep/vlachos-konstantinos/">Prof. Costas Vlahos</a>. In 2008, I graduated with an Engineering Diploma in <a href="http://www.materials.uoi.gr/en/">Materials Engineering</a> from the same university.

<h5>My research</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

Fossil fuels not only cause significant harm to the environment but are also becoming more and more expensive to produce as the resources are slowly getting depleted. I strongly believe that technologies for producing sustainable energy are the only way to move forward, and the challenging role of mechanical engineers is to devise and optimize such technologies. An important part of this challenge is the lack of deep understanding of the relations between the chemical constitution of molecules with their observed macroscopic behavior. To this end, my research and teaching activities revolve around the application of molecular thermodynamics to Process & Energy Engineering in order to create such relations, and also to provide predictions for various thermophysical properties at conditions inaccessible to experiment. I currently focus on two research lines: 
(i) The energy line, in which I investigate hydrogen storage, purification and transportation, and environmentally-friendly solvents for carbon dioxide capture and utilization. 
(ii) The process line, in which I study sustainable adsorbents for the removal of contaminants from water. My work requires large-scale high-performance computing involving a number of powerful molecular simulation methods such as on-the-fly calculations of thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids using molecular dynamics, and phase-, adsorption- and reaction-equilibria using advanced Monte Carlo sampling. My research aims to provide insight at both the fundamental and the application level. To achieve this, I actively collaborate with companies such as TOTAL, HyET Hydrogen and DMT Environmental Tech.
