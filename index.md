<h5>My research in a nutshell</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<!-- Fossil fuels not only harm the environment but are also becoming more and more expensive as the resources are slowly getting depleted or due to (geo)political reasons. I believe that technologies for producing sustainable energy are the only way to move forward, and the challenging role of engineers is to devise and optimize such technologies.  -->
My research and teaching activities revolve around the application of molecular thermodynamics to Process & Energy Engineering in order to accelarate the transition to a more sustainabl future. I currently focus on two research lines: 
(i) I investigate hydrogen storage, purification and transportation, and environmentally-friendly solvents for carbon dioxide capture and utilization. 
(ii) I work towards designing sustainable adsorbents for the removal of contaminants from water. My work requires large-scale high-performance computing and involves a number of powerful molecular simulation methods such as on-the-fly calculations of thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids using molecular dynamics, and phase-, adsorption- and reaction-equilibria using advanced Monte Carlo sampling. My research aims to provide insight at both the fundamental and the application level. To achieve this, I collaborate with partners such as <a href="https://totalenergies.com">TotalEnergies</a>, <a href="https://cyclopure.com">Cyclopure</a>, <a href="https://www.waternet.nl">Waternet</a>, <a href="https://www.witteveenbos.com"> Witteveen & Bos</a>, <a href="https://hyethydrogen.com">HyET Hydrogen</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/xintcglobal.com/xintcglobal">XiNTC</a>, <a href="https://www.tno.nl/nl/">TNO</a>, <a href="https://www.dmt-et.com">DMT Environmental Tech</a>, and various universities and research institutes around the world.
